Your Credit Score is calculated based on information present in your credit report. Your credit report presents details about your credit accounts, credit application and debt repayment, among others.</string>

    <string name="secret_ans_13">There are five prime factors that go towards deciding your Credit Score. They are - debt repayment, credit utilisation ratio, average credit age, type of credit account (secured / unsecured) and Credit Score enquiries made.</string>
    <string name="secret_ans_14">You did nothing wrong and yet your Credit Score is low?

    <string name="tips_1_ans_1">A credit score is a measure of an individual\'s ability to pay back the borrowed amount.10 It is the numerical representation of their creditworthiness. A credit score is a 3 digit number that falls in the range of 300-900, 900 being the highest.10 You should always work towards reaching a credit score that is close to 900. A higher credit score offers you several benefits and helps you at the time of getting a loan or a credit card.10 Having a low credit score suggests you have not been a responsible borrower and have been slacking off repaying the borrowed sum.10 Credit scores are calculated by the credit bureaus in the country after taking into consideration several factors like the length of your credit history, repayment records, credit inquiries, among others. 10 When you apply for a loan or a credit card, lenders like banks and non banking finance companies check your credit score to see whether you have the ability to repay the credit. 10If you have a higher credit score, you are entitled to receive preferential pricing and get discounts on the interest rate.10 Moreover, a high credit score gives your the additional power to negotiate for better rates of interest on loans.

    <string name="tips_2_ans_1">A credit score ranges between 300-900. The closer your credit score is to 900, higher the chances are for you to get a good deal for loan as well as credit card. Let\'s take a look at the different credit score range: 10 ➽ NA/NH : In order to calculate your credit score, you need to have a credit history. If you have no credit history, your credit report will mention that your credit score is NA/NH. 10 ➽ 300-550 :A credit score in this range is considered as a poor credit score. It suggests that you have defaulted your payments and have unpaid dues. 10 ➽ 550-650 : A credit score in this range is considered as average. You will still have to take measures to improve your credit score. 10 ➽ 650-750 : A credit score is this range is considered as good and lenders will consider granting you credit in the form of loan or credit card. However, you might still not be in the position to negotiate for a good deal. 10 ➽ 750-900 : With a credit score in this range, you will be less likely to turn as a defaulter and lenders will be willing to offer you with a great deal for loan as well as credit cards. A credit score in this range also gives you the additional power to negotiate for better deal in terms of credit card rewards and interest rates.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_2">➽Your Credit Score is computed by Credit Information Companies. There are four companies in Indian which do the job - CIBIL TransUnion, Experian, Equifax and High Mark.10➽Let\'s unveil the mystery around how these companies compute your score. When you make a transaction the one that is relevant to determine your score banks send details about it to all four credit bureaus.10➽ To send details to all credit agencies is a mandate by the RBI. Essentially, banks keep Credit Information Companies up-to-date about your monetary habits. 10➽If a bank needs to check your Credit Score, they can approach any one of the bureaus. It doesn\'t matter which one because all will have the same score for you all four are equally authoritative and on par with each other. 10➽After receiving information from the bank, credit bureaus get down to the task of collecting more information about your financial habits from other banks and financial institutions. 10➽The credit bureaus then processes this information to formulate what is called a Credit Report. 10 Now, what is a Credit Report? A Credit Report is your financial marks card. It contains your Credit Score. It\'s wiser to check your score from time to time.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_3">It is very important that you keep a close eye on your Credit Score. It is the best way to gauge your chances to get a line of credit. Another reason why you should track your score is to know if it dips, or if an error has been made by credit agencies while calculating your score. This will help you make timely amends.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_4">Though the processes followed to compute your score might differ from agency to agency, your Credit Score calculated by all will be the same. This is because banks intimate the relevant information to all four agencies. Therefore, no matter which agency a bank picks to check your Credit Score, there will be no major discrepancy in it. 10 Of the four agencies, CIBIL, however, is the most popular since it was one of the first Credit Information Companies to start operations in India. This has fuelled the notion that CIBIL Score is more accurate than a score from other agencies. This, however, is not true. Banks give equal weightage to scores from all four agencies. Equifax Experian and High Mark Credit Scores are as good to banks and other financial institutions as CIBIL Score. 10 BankBazaar has tied up with Experian, which means that we can help you check your Credit Score for free. Otherwise, it costs a few hundred rupees.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_5">Though many believe this, it\'s not true. 10➽ All Credit Information Companies, including CIBIL, create your Credit Reports which tell banks about you credibility. 10➽Second, CIBIL and the other credit agencies do not entertain requests from individuals to make changes to financial details in Credit Reports. Changes are incorporated when banks provide relevant information to these agencies. 10➽This ensures that information in your Credit Report is legitimate. After all, your Credit Score is one of the most important factors considered by banks when deciding about your loan or Credit Card application. Your Credit Score also determines the interest rate banks chalk up for you. 10➽ So make sure that you score big on this one!</string>

    <string name="tips_3_ans_2">It is understood that having high balances on your credit cards can significantly reduce your credit score. Apart from that, there are several other factors that can hurt your credit score: 10 ➽ Being late on your credit payments. 10 ➽ Completely ignoring your loan dues/credit card bills. 10 ➽ Creditors charge off accounts when credit card bills are not paid on time. The status of having your account charged off is one of the worst incidents that reflects on your credit score. 10 ➽ Lenders use third-party debt collectors to retrieve the loan amount from you, in case they do not receive payments. Having your account sent to collections reflects very poorly on your credit score. 10 ➽ Filing for bankruptcy can have a devastating effect on your credit score. 10 ➽ When you request to close a credit card that has an outstanding balance, your credit limit drops to Rs.0. This is similar to a situation where you have maxed out your credit card. 10 ➽ Closing old credit cards shortens your credit history. This has a negative impact on your credit score. 10 ➽ Applying for multiple credit cards or loans within a short duration makes your credit score plunge. Hence, it is advisable to limit the number of applications. 10 ➽ Having only one type of credit account will negatively impact your credit score. So, you should look to maintain a mix of loans and credit card debts and make consistent payments on time. 10 ➽ If you fail to check your credit report occasionally and fix errors, if any, your credit score can be hurt.

    <string name="tips_3_ans_3">When you work on improving your credit, you should be very patient, so as to not get discouraged. Credit scores are calculated from your credit report. When you request for the score from multiple credit reporting bureaus, you may see a slight variance in the figures. This is fine, as long as the difference is not massive. 10➽ In order to understand how your credit score changes over time, you should know how often there will be updates to your credit report.

    <string name="tips_3_ans_4">Most of the changes in your credit score happen incrementally.

This includes a delinquency, i.e., a significantly late payment such as a 30-day delay on a credit. 10➽ Another big influence is the credit utilisation ratio. This refers to the amount you owe as debt as opposed to your credit limit. So, an increase in credit card debt will cause your credit utilisation ratio to rise, which in turn drops your credit score. 10➽ Consider another scenario in which you pay off all your credit card debts in one go. Your credit utilisation ratio will fall in this case. This would lead to a temporary hike in your credit score.</string>
